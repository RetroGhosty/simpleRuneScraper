Install Python 3
Link: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/python-3.8.2-amd64.exe

Check if python3 is installed
- Go to cmd then run as administrator and type python --version
It should show the version of python (Python 3.8.2), if not then something is wrong while installing in your computer
  
1. Go to cmd then run as administrator and type
